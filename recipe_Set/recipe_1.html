        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>onions & bell peppers</em></li>
            <li><em>ginger, garlic, green chilies & celery</em></li>
            <li><em>cottage cheese</em></li>
            <li><em>red chili powder</em></li>
            <li><em>black pepper powder</em></li>
            <li><em>cornstarch</em></li>
            <li><em>salt</em></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2><strong>Preparations</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, prep the fresh ingredients. Chop the onions and bell pepper into 1 inch squares. You can use red or green pepper (capsicum).</li>
            <li>Finely chop the ginger, garlic, green chilies and celery. Set aside. Skip celery, if you don’t like it. You can also use spring onion/scallions instead of onions.</li>
            <li>chop the cottage cheese in cubes. Pat dry them completely with a clean kitchen towel. Then add them to a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>add ½ teaspoon red chili powder (or ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper), ½ teaspoon black pepper powder, ½ teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons cornstarch to the paneer cubes.</li>
            <li>Gently shake and toss to mix and thoroughly coat the cheese.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2><strong>Cooking process</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons of preferred neutral-flavored oil in a pan, kadai or wok. The heat should be medium hot for frying.</li>
            <li>Carefully add the paneer cubes. Make sure they do not touch. You might need to work in batches if the pan isn’t quite large enough</li>
            <li>Cook for a few minutes until browned on one side. Then flip and continue to fry all sides of the paneer cubes.</li>
            <li>Take care to not over-fry the cubes, or they will become too chewy and dense.</li>
            <li>In the same pan there will be some oil. So there’s no need to wipe out the pan first. If in case there is no oil or very less oil in the pan, then add 1 tablespoon of oil.Add the chopped onions, bell peppers, ginger, green chilies, garlic and celery.</li>
            <li>Stir well. Keep the heat to medium high as you stir fry.</li>
            <li>While the veggies stir fry, make the light sauce for the dry Manchurian. There will be a bit of leftover cornstarch and spices in the bowl which was used to coat the paneer cubes.</li>
            <li>Add ¼ cup water to this leftover cornstarch & spice mixture. Stir well to create a smooth paste.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, continue to cook the veggies and aromatics over medium high heat, stirring frequently</li>
            <li>Now add ½ tablespoon soy sauce (or 1.5 teaspoons soy sauce) to the pan.</li>
            <li>Then add 1.5 tablespoons tomato ketchup. Ketchup adds a tangy and slightly sweet flavor. For more sweetness you can increase the amount used to 2 tablespoons.</li>
            <li>Stir and mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the cornstarch paste.</li>
            <li> Stir well and bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat. Allow the mixture to cook for one or two minutes, until the sauce starts to thicken</li>
            <li>Once the sauce has thickened, then add the pan fried paneer cubes.</li>
            <li>Gently stir so that the cheese does not break up, but does get thoroughly coated in the sweet, tangy, and salty sauce. Turn off the heat</li>
            <li> Lastly, add ½ teaspoon rice vinegar, apple cider vinegar or regular white vinegar. The acidity really brings the flavors together!</li>
            <li>Stir and check the taste. If needed add more salt, soy sauce, vinegar or black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
