        <h2><strong><em> Pizza Dough</em></strong></h2>
        <h3><em>Preparations</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Yeast:</strong><p>I use Platinum Yeast from Red Star. I have the best results when I use this instant yeast.</p> <p> The Platinum yeast is fantastic because its careful formula strengthens your dough and makes making working with yeast simple.</p> <p>You only need 1 standard packet of yeast (2 and 1/4 teaspoons) to get the job done.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Water: </strong><p> I tested this pizza dough recipe with different amounts of water. 1 and 1/3 cups is the perfect amount. </p><p>Use warm water to cut down on rise time, about 100-110°F. Anything over 130ºF kills the yeast</p></li>
            <li><strong>Oil:</strong><p> A couple Tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil adds wonderful flavor to the dough.</p><p>Don’t forget to brush the dough with olive oil before adding the toppings, which prevents the crust from tasting soggy.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong><p>Salt adds necessary flavor.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong><p> 1 Tablespoon of sugar increases the yeast’s activity and tenderizes the dough, especially when paired with a little olive oil.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Cornmeal:</strong><p>Cornmeal isn’t in the dough, but it’s used to dust the pizza pan. Cornmeal gives the pizza crust a little extra flavor and crisp.</p><p>Most delivery pizzas you enjoy have cornmeal on the bottom crust!</p></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Cooking process</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong><p>Mix the dough ingredients together by hand or use a hand-held or stand mixer.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Knead:</strong><p>Knead by hand or with your mixer. I like doing this by hand.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Rise:</strong><p>Place dough into a greased mixing bowl, cover tightly, and set aside to rise for about 90 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator.</p></li>
        </ol>
